# User-Based Tuning Frontend

This is the frontend of the **User-Based Tuning** project, built with **Vite**. It provides the user interface for interacting with the backend APIs.

## 🔗 Live Demo

You can view the live frontend here: [https://frontend-9tgv.onrender.com](https://frontend-9tgv.onrender.com)

## ⚙️ Features

- Responsive UI for user interactions
- Connects with backend APIs via environment variable `VITE_APP_BACKEND_URL`
- Built using Vite for fast development and production builds

I can also make a **combined README for both frontend and backend** that shows the full project structure and links to both live services if you want.  

Do you want me to create that too?
